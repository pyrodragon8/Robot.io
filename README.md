# Robot.io 
A Google and Summer of Tech Hackathon Project

##About
Robot.io is an android app that allows the user to connect   
their robot and stream the live camera recording from the robot to app.  

Designed primarily for demonstrating to students in [ENGR301](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/ecs/study/courses/engr-101)   
and motivating them in electronics and programming.   

#Features
Robot.io is an app that can connect to a robot via http or sockets and control it (SO MUCH NETWORKING WAS INVOLVED!!!). We also had to configure the robot to accept the app's request.    
Our app is capable of displaying a full screen live video stream of camera connected to raspberry pi that can be mounted on top of the robot.    

Here is a [test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfxAfsd5Tiw&list=WL&index=39) of our app controlling Victoria University's NIARC Robot
